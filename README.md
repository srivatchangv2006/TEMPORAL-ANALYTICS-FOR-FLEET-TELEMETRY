A real-time analytics project for fleet vehicle telemetry using Kafka for data streaming and Azure Blob Storage for data persistence. The project includes a data producer, a consumer for vehicle data, and a dashboard for analytics.

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion from vehicles
- Kafka-based streaming architecture
- Data storage in Azure Blob
- Temporal analytics and dashboard visualization

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Kafka (local or remote)
- Azure Blob Storage account

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Download and install Kafka from [Apache Kafka Downloads](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
   - Start Zookeeper and Kafka server:
     ```bash
     # Start Zookeeper
     bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
     # Start Kafka
     bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
     ```
   - Create the required topic (e.g., `vehicle-data`):
     ```bash
     bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic vehicle-data --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
     ```

4. **Configure Azure Blob Storage:**
   - Set your Azure Blob credentials as environment variables or in a `.env` file (see code for details).

## How to Run

- **Producer:**
  ```bash
  python producer.py
  ```
- **Consumer:**
  ```bash
  python consumer_for_vehicle.py
  ```
- **Dashboard/Analytics:**
  ```bash
  python vehicle.py
  ```

## Running with Docker

You can run the entire stack (Kafka, Zookeeper, and your app) using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Steps:

1. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Download and install from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. **Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

3. **Set your Azure Blob connection string:**
   - Option 1: Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and set the value for `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` under `app:`.
   - Option 2: Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
     ```
     AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
     ```

4. **Build and start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - This will start Zookeeper, Kafka, and your app (by default, runs `python producer.py`).

5. **To run the consumer or dashboard instead:**
   - Edit the `command:` line under `app:` in `docker-compose.yml` to:
     ```yaml
     command: python consumer_for_vehicle.py
     ```
     or
     ```yaml
     command: python vehicle.py
     ```
   - Then re-run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

6. **Stopping everything:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, then run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```

7. **(Optional) View logs:**
   - To see logs for your app:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs app
     ```

> **Note:** Docker and Docker Compose files are provided for convenience. If you do not have Docker, you can run the project locally using the instructions above.

These videos walk through different parts of my project. I‚Äôve mainly used English while explaining, but I‚Äôve also included some informal Tamil for better clarity.

The videos cover:

Displaying data on an interactive Folium map

Training and testing the ML model

Showing Prediction vs Actual comparison

Running the Python command-line interface

Explaining the flow from Kafka Producer ‚Üí Kafka Consumer ‚Üí Azure Blob Storage ‚Üí Azure Analytics

(Note: These videos are informal and made to explain the concepts clearly in a mix of English and Tamil.)
